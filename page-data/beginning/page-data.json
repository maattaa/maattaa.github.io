Contentwise you will find Information Security related posts, such as Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups, experiments and guides and whatever I might happen to post - time will show.</p>\n<p>This blog will be as minimalistic as possible and new features will be implemented only if required. Keep it simple.</p>\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p>Blog has been something I have been thinkin about writing to, but also maintaining. I wanted to have minimalistic solution, but something that is modern and nothing that is too tied to the platform with out-of-box solutions. However, I did not have any idea what there should be besides <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">Githup pages</a>. Githup pages are something I run into often, and for some reason wanted</p>\n<h1>Technology</h1>\n<p>I have done some fullstack with React so something with JS and TS would help to maintain my skills, but node-React will be overkill as there is no need for a backend. Github Pages’ <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll\">documentation</a> recommends <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> as static site generator. It would do the job, but it runs on Ruby. I have not found use for ruby besides configuring Vagrant, so these skills might not be that useful in the future. On the other hand <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com\">GatsbyJS</a> uses JavaScript as you might have figured out, so I wanted to look into it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a> is also one option. I want to mention it here, as it uses Golang, making it’s builds faster than Jekyll’s or Gatsbys. Golang is also interesting as it has low-level abilities but is readable and modern, something that C doesn’t fall under to. Hugo has standalone HTTP server, which is most likely enough for smaller sites, but as stated, there is no need for server when using Github Pages. The core product has no dependencies which I assume are something similar to <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code> in <code class=\"language-text\">npm</code> deployments, something which often take significant amount of space in development environment. React <a href=\"https://www.wictorwilen.se/blog/how-to-add-a-react-script-to-hugo/\">can be used</a> with Hugo, but compared to GatsbyJS which has its functionality built in React Hugo’s React support seems like something you should not base everything on. I still might switch to Hugo later on.</p>\n<p>Back to Gatsby. Gatsby is a framework run on top of <code class=\"language-text\">npm</code>. If you have done React using npm you will find a lot of common elements, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>package.json with dependency requirements and scripts,</li>\n<li>Well, it uses the same language..</li>\n<li>Dependencies are installed with <code class=\"language-text\">npm install</code></li>\n<li>Using GraphQL</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project folder structure doesn’t look too common, but</p>\n<h1>Set Up</h1>\n<p>Installing node</p>\n<p>Installing Gatsby</p>\n<p>Initialize project</p>\n<p>Github account?</p>\n<p>Build and Deploy</p>\n<h1>How it works</h1>\n<p>Building on Gatsby</p>\n<p>Github pages</p>\n<h1>DNS</h1>\n<p>CNAME</p>\n<p>Static</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Needed?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting a blog using Github Pages and GatsbyJS","date":"May 23, 2020","description":"First post.
